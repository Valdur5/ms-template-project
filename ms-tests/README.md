System integration testing (SIT) involves the overall testing of a complete system of many subsystem components or elements.

# What should be in THIS module:

* This module is the space for placing system integration tests only!

# What should NOT be in THIS module:

* Unit Tests should go in the same module as the classes which should be tested.
* Integration Tests should be located in the ms-ws for the REST web services and depended on the purpose also in the corresponding package.
